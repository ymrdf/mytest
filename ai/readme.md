Installer for Windows for Tesseract 3.05, Tesseract 4 and Tesseract 5 are available from Tesseract at UB Mannheim. These include the training tools. Both 32-bit and 64-bit installers are available.

An installer for the OLD version 3.02 is available for Windows from our download page. This includes the English training data. If you want to use another language, download the appropriate training data, unpack it using 7-zip, and copy the .traineddata file into the ‘tessdata’ directory, probably C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata.

To access tesseract-OCR from any location you may have to add the directory where the tesseract-OCR binaries are located to the Path variables, probably C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR.

Experts can also get binaries build with Visual Studio from the build artifacts of the Appveyor Continuous Integration.
